Participating in 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenges by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos). They can be found here: [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

*Motivation:*
Having used Javascript on several projects over the last few years I wanted to do a dedicated course to look for and cover any gaps in my self-taught knowledge.
