# JavaScript30

Participating in 30 Day Vanilla JS Challenges by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos). They can be found here: [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

_Motivation:_
Having used Javascript on several projects over the last few years I wanted to do a dedicated course to look for and cover any gaps in my self-taught knowledge.

**Log/Notes**

_Day 01 - Drum kit:_
Very straightforward keypress handling and class changing.

_Day 02 - JS/CSS Clock:_
Chrome devtools for producing bezier transition curves is really cool.

_Day 03 - CSS Variables:_
Interesting to see the benefits of CSS variables over SCSS variables like I normally use. (update with JS)
